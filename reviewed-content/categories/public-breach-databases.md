### Build Pick: Custom ES Cluster

* go to [https://breached.to/Announcement-Database-Index](https://breached.to/Announcement-Database-Index)
* download as many as you can
* parse them and import to ElasticSearch
* highly recommend using Jupyter + Spark to do this ([https://hub.docker.com/r/jupyter/all-spark-notebook/](https://hub.docker.com/r/jupyter/all-spark-notebook/))
* elastic connector for spark
* even on modest hardware, can process/import over 2 million records per hour
* Total size will cap out around \~10billion records
* I am working to release this to the public

### Buy Pick: Dehashed

* $15.50/month, or $179 annually
* separate pricing for API credits and web access
  * API pricing: $3 for 100 credits
* Contains passwords
* certain sensitive data is not accessible to normal accounts (i.e. SSNs)
* offensive focus, but could be useful for defenders to determine what is exposed/change passwords

### Also Worth It: Have I Been Pwned (HIBP)

* worth it, $3.50 per month subscription fee
* highly effective data breach notification service
* passwords accessible in certain circumstances

### IntelX

* pricing unclear, but can use https://phonebook.cz for free to gather certain attributes (i.e. email addresses)
